# Issues

## Issue # 1: - When there are more than 50 rows, and I select the ENTIRE spreadsheet manually, and then COPY using "C TRL + C" (or "âŒ˜ + C" for Mac), pasting into MS Excel does not work at all AND the page freezes.

## Issue # 2 - When I COPY the ENTIRE spreadsheet programmatically, and there are more than 50 rows, pasting into MS Excel does not work properly.

## 12/14/2021

It seems that if there are more rows than the UI can show, then programmatic copy & paste does not work correctly, unless you scroll **ALL** the way to the bottom of the spreadsheet so that all rows have rendered in the UI. 

**More specifically, it seems to pertain to cells that have been added programmatically, but not rendered in the UI yet**. 

THIS VIDEO DEMONSTRATION MAY MAKE IT EASIER TO EXPLAIN:

**NOTE**: Manual copy/paste still does not work with a large data-set and it still locks-up the browser
